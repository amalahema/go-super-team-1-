                                <p class="card-text">The upper body consists of 5 major muscle groups, which are the chest, shoulders, triceps, back, and biceps. The exercises tend to go hand in hand, like how chest, shoulders, and triceps are pushing movements, and back and biceps commonly being trained together, because they are pulling movements. It's important to utilize compund movements like the Bench Press becuase it works not only the chest, but also the shoulders and triceps.  Having a developed upper body makes everyday life a little bit easier, whether it be physically looking better and being able to move heavy things without straining your back so much, or mentally feeling confident and better about yourself. The following resources direct you to videos on how to work specific parts of the upper body, as well as the anatomy for them.

                                <p class="card-text">The lower half of the body is neglected often because it's hard to train, but it is a whole half of your body, so you don't want to look super-imbalanced. The lower body mainly consists of 3 major sections, which is the quads, the hamstrings, and the calves. The quads are considered the tricep of the legs, growing well with exercises that shorten the muscle like leg extensions, and compound movements like the squat. However, the hamstrings are considered as the bicep of the leg because you use curling motions to grow, as well as hip hinge movements. You can't forget the calves, they may be annoying to train after doing physically demanding exercises, but it's a must so your legs are balanced all around. More info on how to work them are under the resources.

                                <p class="card-text">It's very important that you follow an organized workout split that allows you to hit specific muscles at least twice a week, and gives you at least 48 hours of rest between working them, so they're fully recovered and ready to be worked again. It's also integral to not overtrain by doing too many sets (known as junk volume) so you're not still fatigued by the time it's time to work them again. A good solution for that is to space out types of workouts throughout the week with a split. However, there are different types of splits to accomodate to your weekly schedule, such as the Upper/Lower, Push/Pull/Legs, the Arnold Split, etc. Following a split that can allow you to consistently be active in the gym and progressively improve is a major key to be successful in your journey.

                                <p class="card-text">Cardio is an underrated component of the gym, considering it can literally help you live longer. There are plenty of proven benefits of cardio, such as lowering your blood pressure, burning excess calories, improving sleep, strengthing your immune system, and the list goes on. There are different kinds of cardio you can do, such as LISS (Low Intensity Steady State), and HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training). Examples of LISS would just be exercises that aren't too intense, rather for longer periods of time, such as cycling, swimming, and brisk walking. However, HIIT sessions are pretty intense, and is very physically demanding, but are done in shorter periods of time. If you're already doing a tough weekly split, LISS would probably be the way to go so you can still burn some extra calories, but not be burned out for lifting sessions. </p>
